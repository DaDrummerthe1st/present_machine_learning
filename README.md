# Background work for project
### [Differentiate Pictures For Auto Sync (DPFAS)](https://github.com/DaDrummerthe1st/differentiate-pictures-for-auto-sync)
This is done as a project for a school assignment at TUC Yrkesh√∂gskola and the program Data Manager
## DPFAS
Aims to help the user to sort between important and discardable image files.
This prephase discussess and displays alternative methods to render the models needed to classify and predict user behavior.
## Concrete goals
- Motivate different machine learning techniques for each need
- Simple explanation of each choice
- Presentation with Streamlit
- Deployment on Streamlit platform
## Process
I will not manage to finish all goals within the scope of this course. This method is chosen in order to get as far as possible within the boundries of machine learning.
### Priority
1. Get a Streamlit up and running locally
2. Create topics
3. Create a dictionary of words
3. Create an overview of potential machine learning methods
3. Explain Logistic Regression
4. Create examples of use of Logistic Regression
5. Create a POC of DPFAS
6. Exemplify dataframes and data rendered by the different models and correlation to predictive model
7. Explain CNN, regression, prediction and other methods
8. Delve deeper into each subject by explaining the math behind it
